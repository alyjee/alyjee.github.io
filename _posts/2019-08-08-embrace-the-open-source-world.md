Open-source, I've been hearing the word since my university days and I also knew what it meant, lexically! But today let me tell you something, open-source is one the greatest things on this planet that have ever happened to us, it's the true meaning of **sharing is caring**!

I've never been confident about anything like this much. From the core of my heart I truly believe knowledge is not something to be kept in a treasure box, it's the kind of treasure which increases if shared. Sadly I understood this a bit late but better late than never, right? So what is open-source actually? Let's dig a bit deeper.

Basically what open-source means, you make develop something and you open it to the world, why people do that? There are basically two reasons for this.

- Others like you can use your code and learn from it, save some time.
- People can make comments about your code so you could know what weaknesses your code has.

Sounds great isn't it!

If someone wants to learn something in the very best way I believe the person should get involved with open-source community. Take some open-sourced projects from the tech giants of today and you absorp every bit of it. Trust me you will learn a lot and learning from the creator of the code itself has a pretty great impact.

For example if you are someone like me who's been doing PHP for quite sometime and claims that he loves Laravel, you should follow [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell) and others too (I can't right the names becuase it will be unfair to not write all of the names :P), grab some open-sourced code of his and breath it in. There are tons of other projects available on github for you. Just go and grab'em!
