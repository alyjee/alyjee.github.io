**Hello world**, this is my first [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog post and here I'm a little afraid but full of excitement and quite ready to share my experiences with rest of the world and open to comments.

> **Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post

This very sentence is already written in Jekyll's documentation and I think this says it all. For a long time I've been thinking about starting a blog of my own but I was a bit afraid to do so. I even started on the famous platform [blogger](https://www.blogger.com) during my university days but I couldn't keep up to create healthy content due to the consistent work load but here I'm again with a fresh start as they say:

Recently I read an article on the importance of having a personal blog on medium, which pushed me to just start it as soon as possible. I strongly recommend everyone to have thier own blog as this the article explains it helps you polish your writing skills, share you knowledge - findings and experiences with the rest of the world.

I beleive there are lots of other good resources out there, but everyone has their own way of explaining things and you never know, you can be a helping hand for someone out there, searching for just something you've written in your blog.

I hope you like it!
