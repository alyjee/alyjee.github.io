Twitter, yes you've heared of it before but not in a manner I'm going to explain today. This post is about the how useful twitter is for every professional especially us software engineers. In this post I'll explain how you can get most out of it just by using it the right way.

So twitter is not a usual social media platform where people will just post the picture of their dogs, social events or other nonesense you see these days on different social platforms. Twitter is a legit one! What I mean is twitter is a platform where real people express their ideas in a very concise way. Now a days everybody is using twitter; scientists, musicians, developers, entrepreneurs and any other you can think of.

To support my statement I'm gonna share some stats with you guys. So (according to statista.com)[https://www.statista.com/statistics/303681/twitter-users-worldwide/] there were 235.1 million users on twitter in 2014 and the projected number for 2020 is 275 million.

But that's enough about the importance, let's come to the point "How to use twitter?". I'm gonna break it down for guys in a few simple steps.
- First of all follow the people of your community. For example, if you're using Laravel you should follow the people who are building the framework, this will tell you the where the framework is going in future, the current issues going on around if any.
- Be attentive, and participate as much as you can.
- Grab the pointers from the tweets and you'll know where the things are gonna go in future.
- Be profession, polite and respectful all the time.
