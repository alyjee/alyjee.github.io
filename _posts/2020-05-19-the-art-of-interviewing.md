As far as I can tell, after 5 years of experience in the field and appearing in numerous interviews with a number of great organizations, interviewing is an art.

Beleive it or not, hiring the perfect person for the job is as difficult as summiting the mount everest without supplementry oxygen. I have been working in the field of Software Engineering for over 5 years now and I have appeared in many interviews. I really like to test my skills and I always want to know what kind of latest tech terms are in town and what HR managers are looking for in a candidate these days. And I think interviews are one the best free option to do that.

After being interviewed by a bunch of different people I have come to a conclusion. Interview is really subjective to the interviewers own perspectives. And I think that is very tricky and difficult to judge how the interviewers are going to question you and how they will receive your responses. So in my opinion there should be some organized process for the interviews, especially in Pakistan, that is how everyone can get a similar chance to get hired. In contrary if an interviewee has encountered a not-in-good-mood interviewer that is bad luck.

Despite all the above mentioned stuff I do have some tips for the interviewers and as the time goes by I will try to add more and more in this blog post. I hope this will be useful for people. So without a further ado, here they are:

1. Instead of asking for the termnologies, try to question the interviewees with a concept. For example if you are interviewing a person for Python instead of asking him/her directly What are list comprehensions? ask the person to create a list from anyother iterable object and if the person knows the concept then it is ok if he/she has forgotten the termonology.
