The great people I follow in industry has been writing this post for quite some time now so this year I am also going to start. As you all know, the year 2019 has already ended, so I think it's time to write down some highlights of mine this year.

Honestly speaking I do not really have anything big like other tech gurus to write but I am writing this post so that I can take out some time in the coming year to do some stuff so that I can write my next post "A Recap of 2020" with some good achievements. Ok so enough of the explanation, let's see what I have been doing this year.

Here the a few things I have been doing this year:
 - Started reading lots of tech articles.
 - Started some joint ventures with my friends to have a good impact on the society.
 - As an **achievement** I got hired in one of the best companies on Europe. Will be writing about this in details once I am there.
