<h1>Dagri Bangla! - From Mountains Top to the Depths of Forest</h1>

<p class="view">by Tahir R.</p>

<p><strong>Dagri Bangla</strong>, is situated in the middle of a thick, virgin forest situated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagri_Naka">“Dagri Naka”</a>, according to wikipedia “Dagri” means “The home of leopards”, and yes we recently had a chance to visit the place and it was an out of the world kind of experience for me.</p>

<p>For me travelling is as important for life as breathing, I beleive adventurous tours are what makes you more stronger, they make value the things you’ve in your daily life and usually you don’t really notice the importance of such things. You can relate my opinoin with Gustave Flaubert like so,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Travel makes one modest. You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world. - Gustave Flaubert</p>
