<p>As the title is a bit hard to get, so I will straight explain what this is all about. In this on-going times of uncertainty I would like to share my personal opinions on the importance of smile. Yes, smile! you know when you smile you just contract a few muscles to a few centimeters, those are the few centimeters that can make a huge difference.</p>

<p>I know there are tons of pretty good blog posts out there which goes into technical/biological details on how a human being smiles, so as I am no good at that, I am not gonna explain that part but I will leave a few good-read links of such blogs posts at the end of this blog. As of today we all are going through a really hard time. A global pandemic named as Covid-19 has caught us all out of the blue, the world has never experienced something like this before. The only cure for this plague is social distancing and we, humans, now really know how much we are connected to each other. But this disease has led everyone to a quarantine. People are stuck in their rooms with multiple gadets but with really few human beings. This has indulge an enourmous amount of depression in most of us.</p>

<p>Here I want to emphasize on the importance of smiling. This is the need of the hour, this is needed as never before because we all need to stay positive to keep our health and immune system at a good level. We all should practice smiling. Try to remember the good days of your lives, remember when you once met your good old lad after a very long time. We all have to stay positive in this time of uncertainity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peace begins with a smile. - Mother Teresa</p>

<p>So the one liner, just keep smiling and we all will get through this!</p>
