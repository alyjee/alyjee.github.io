<h1>Bloggin Noob!</h1>

<p class="view">by Tahir R.</p>

<p><strong>Hello world</strong>, this is my first <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog post and here I’m a little afraid but full of excitement and quite ready to share my experiences with rest of the world and open to comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hello world</strong>, this is my first Jekyll blog post</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hello-world.jpg" alt="hello world" /></p>

<p>This very sentence is already written in Jekyll’s documentation and I think this says it all. For a long time I’ve been thinking about starting a blog of my own but I was a bit afraid to do so. I even started on the famous platform <a href="https://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> during my university days but I couldn’t keep up to create healthy content due to the consistent work load but here I’m again with a fresh start as they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s never too late for a new morning! - Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I read an article on the importance of having a personal blog on medium, which pushed me to just start it as soon as possible. I strongly recommend everyone to have thier own blog as this the article explains it helps you polish your writing skills, share you knowledge - findings and experiences with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I beleive there are lots of other good resources out there, but everyone has their own way of explaining things and you never know, you can be a helping hand for someone out there, searching for just something you’ve written in your blog.</p>

<p>I hope you like it!</p>
