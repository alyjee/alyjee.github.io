<h1>Embrace The Open Source World</h1>

<p class="view">by Tahir R.</p>

<p>Open-source, I’ve been hearing the word since my university days and I also knew what it meant, lexically! But today let me tell you something, open-source is one the greatest things on this planet that have ever happened to us, it’s the true meaning of <strong>sharing is caring</strong>!</p>

<p>I’ve never been confident about anything like this much. From the core of my heart I truly believe knowledge is not something to be kept in a treasure box, it’s the kind of treasure which increases if shared. Sadly I understood this a bit late but better late than never, right? So what is open-source actually? Let’s dig a bit deeper.</p>

<p>Basically what open-source means, you make develop something and you open it to the world, why people do that? There are basically two reasons for this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Others like you can use your code and learn from it, save some time.</li>
  <li>People can make comments about your code so you could know what weaknesses your code has.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds great isn’t it!</p>

<p>If someone wants to learn something in the very best way I believe the person should get involved with open-source community. Take some open-sourced projects from the tech giants of today and you absorp every bit of it. Trust me you will learn a lot and learning from the creator of the code itself has a pretty great impact.</p>

<p>For example if you are someone like me who’s been doing PHP for quite sometime and claims that he loves Laravel, you should follow <a href="https://github.com/taylorotwell">Taylor Otwell</a> and others too (I can’t right the names becuase it will be unfair to not write all of the names :P), grab some open-sourced code of his and breath it in. There are tons of other projects available on github for you. Just go and grab’em!</p>
