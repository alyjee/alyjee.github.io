Planet EARTH, our home. Mankind has been living at this beautiful planet for centuries and killing it day by day. We humans, we'll never care about our planet until we're making profit over it. Giants like steel and chemical industries won't stop to pollute the environment as long as there're making a living on it. There's a sever need of force, punishment and self-analysis to make it stop! The EARTH is dying and we have to stop it.
