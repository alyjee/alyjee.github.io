Things I have learned in Germany || Exposure is the Key!



You know whenever an interviewer asks you why you want to move abroad/remote location to the new company and we always respond like "Just to gain more exposure!". I have realized this is not just a simple answer you give to HR just to get hired - it's actually a lot more than that.



See I believe during the course of your professional growth it is really important that you grow as a person also. Being a better person is also a very important aspect in order to improve in your job. Does not matter which field you are in, if you are not improving yourself as a person you really need to work on that.



When you are around diverse culture people you know closely what's going on.



You know we always get these quotes, talks and motivational speeches where people talk about you try to be a better person - but the problem is we read, hear some stuff which is actually right but somewhere deep down in our hearts we don't really believe it for example - a smile goes a long way - we all know that it's true but unless you see someone actually practicing this it's hard to believe. People tend to follow the actual people practicing the things they say and that's important I think. Maybe this is how we are designed.



Here in this blog, I am sharing some of my personal experiences which I believe are helping me to be a better person.



Sharing is caring - but not actually just caring it actually enhances your knowledge, skills both - like sanjin helps me in Frontend, victor in design patterns, alex is management skills.



Always, always find ways to make your job easier, like alex added a bookmark for adding shopping_dev.php



Always think before you speak.



Always know the Whys? If you are working on something you should know why you are implementing this code like this? code example needs to be turned into a generic example.



Appreciate the little things.



A smile goes a long way.



Celebrate everything, even the smallest achievement matters! Does not have to be a big party always but just like emoticons in slack you know



Alex appreciated her wive's giving her the healthy sandwich snack, the look in his eyes, the appreciation he had in his expression was something I really never saw in myself, this made me question about a lot stuff related to me - am I actually appreciating the efforts of people aroiung me helping me acheive my goals without even caring about their future - this can be anyone - your parents, wife, friends or mentor.
