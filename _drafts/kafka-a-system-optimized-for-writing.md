Apache KAFKA is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn, it's written in Java and Scala. It aims to provide a unified, low-latency, high throughput platform for handling real time data feed. If all of this doesn't making any sense right now just read along.

## Meet The Team Who Built The Dream

There are almost 30 people's in the team who have built KAFKA uptil now and they are listed as commiters on Apache KAFKA's commiters list. Visit this link to have a  look at the awesome people.

[Apache KAFKA Commiters](https://kafka.apache.org/committers)

Although there're many people in the team but three names come up once you google about the team and the names are:

 1. [Jun Rao](http://www.linkedin.com/in/junrao)
 2. [Neha Narkhede](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nehanarkhede)
 3. [Jay Kreps](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaykreps)

The reason is, these are the three people who created a new company named [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) with a focus on Kafka and took it to the next level.

## Man Behind The Name

So one might think what's with this name "KAFKA", why the tool is named like this. When asked on quora on March 2014, Jay Kreps replied that it's named after a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer, [Franz Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka), and Jay also added that he liked the writer during his college.
